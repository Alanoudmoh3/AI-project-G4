Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, 
which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, 
and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age.
Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease.


we decide to Work on this project because heart failure disease is one of the most common causes of death in the worldwide.
 Also, the risk of passing away from a sudden cardiac arrest is increased.
 Five years after being diagnosed with heart failure, 50% of patients will have passed away,
 most likely from sudden cardiac arrest.
This makes the illness as deadly as many cancers.
