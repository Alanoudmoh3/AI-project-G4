Project motivation:

We decide to Work on this project because heart failure disease is one of the most common causes of death in the worldwide.

Also, your risk of passing away from a sudden cardiac arrest is increased by the condition.
Five years after being diagnosed with heart failure, 50% of patients will have passed away,
most likely from sudden cardiac arrest.
This makes the illness as deadly as many cancers.
