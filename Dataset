Heart Failure Predection Dataset

goal:
We aim to raise awareness about the risk factors of the heart failure. 

People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk 
(due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease)
need early detection and management where in a machine learning model can be of great help.


Source
This dataset was created by combining different datasets already available independently but not combined before.
In this dataset, 5 heart datasets are combined over 11 common features which makes it the largest heart disease dataset available so far for research purposes.
The five datasets used for its curation are:

Cleveland: 303 observations
Hungarian: 294 observations
Switzerland: 123 observations
Long Beach VA: 200 observations
Stalog (Heart) Data Set: 270 observations
Total: 1190 observations
Duplicated: 272 observations

Final dataset: 918 observations
